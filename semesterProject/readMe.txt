The three games I chose: Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Darts

The Theme of the site: Plains/Prarie

The overall audience of the site is just for classmates or the professor, but if it were to become public, then I'm not sure.
I would expect people who like plains areas to visit; maybe people would use the JS as a learning tool.

I'm not expecting much to come from the site, be it grade-wise or not.

There were a bunch of issues when making the site, especially the games.
